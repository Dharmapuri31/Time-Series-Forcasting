# Time-Series-Forcasting

Predicting how a stock market functions is probably one of the most difficult tasks. Time series forecasting can be framed as a supervised learning problem. This re-framing of your time series data gives the access to the suite of standard linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms on your problem.

Traditionally, time series forecasting is dominated by linear methods because they are well understood and effective on many simpler forecasting problems.
In this project we use LSTM, CNN and Fully connected neural networks to predict the stock price using time series forecasting
