# Time-Series-Forcasting

Predicting how a stock market functions is probably one of the most difficult tasks. Time series forecasting can be framed as a supervised learning problem. This re-framing of your time series data gives the access to the suite of standard linear and nonlinear machine learning algorithms on your problem.<br/>

Traditionally, time series forecasting is dominated by linear methods because they are well understood and effective on many simpler forecasting problems.<br/>

In this project we use LSTM, CNN and Fully connected neural networks to predict the stock price using time series forecasting

The following Python libraries have been used.

# Dataset Used
JPM.csv and CSC215_P2_Stock_Price
